**Conductor CLI** is rubber ducking reimagined with AI experts. Talk through your problems with a complete development team that actually understands your context ‚Äì from PM to design to code to ship to secure. Built with Gallifrey Consulting's security-by-design principles and powered by **Claude Code** and **Anthropic's Claude AI**.

**Perfect for**: Web developers who want automatic expert consultation, GitHub-integrated workflows, Next.js applications, React projects, TypeScript codebases, and any development team that wants enterprise-grade security without the complexity.

## ü¶Ü **Why Rubber Ducking with AI?**

Traditional rubber ducking helps you think through problems by explaining them out loud. **Conductor CLI takes this further** ‚Äì you explain your problems to AI experts who actually respond with contextual advice, suggestions, and implementation guidance. It's like having a senior developer, designer, DevOps engineer, and security expert all rubber ducking with you simultaneously.
