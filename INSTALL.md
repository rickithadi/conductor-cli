## üë• Natural Command Interface

### Traditional vs Enhanced:

| Traditional | Enhanced | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `multi-agent recommend` | `conductor ask` | Natural conversation |
| `multi-agent status` | `conductor health` | Quick team status |
| Complex flags | `conductor explain --simple` | User-friendly options |
| No context | `conductor consult "problem"` | Professional consultation focus |

### Smart Aliases:
```bash
# These all work:
conductor ask "question"
conductor consult "question"     # Professional consultation
conductor explain "topic"
conductor review
conductor audit                  # Review alias  
conductor ship "feature"
conductor watch                  # Dashboard alias
```
