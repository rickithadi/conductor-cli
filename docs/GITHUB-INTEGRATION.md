# 🐙 GitHub Integration Guide

> **Native GitHub workflow integration for the complete AI development team**

Conductor CLI integrates seamlessly with GitHub to provide AI-powered development workflows directly in your repository. Your complete development team from PM to ship works with your GitHub workflow.

---

## 🚀 **Quick Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Active GitHub repository 
- Conductor CLI initialized in your project

### **Installation**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# macOS
brew install gh

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gh

# Windows
winget install GitHub.CLI

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Initialize Conductor with GitHub integration
conductor init --github
```

---

## 🦆 **Rubber Ducking with GitHub Context**

The AI team understands your GitHub repository context automatically:

### **Repository Context Awareness**
```bash
# The AI team automatically knows about:
# - Your repository structure
# - Open issues and PRs
# - Recent commits and changes
# - GitHub Actions workflows
# - Branch policies and protection rules

conductor explain "How should I approach fixing issue #42?"
# AI team will read the issue and provide contextual guidance
```

### **Pull Request Discussions**
```bash
# Discuss PR strategy before creating
conductor discuss "I want to refactor the auth system, how should I structure this PR?"

# Get implementation guidance
conductor ask @devops "What should the CI/CD pipeline test for this change?"
conductor ask @security "What security considerations should I include?"
```

---

## 🔄 **Pull Request Workflows**

### **Creating Pull Requests with AI**
```bash
# Create PR with AI-generated title and description
conductor github pr create --auto

# Create PR from specific conversation
conductor github pr create --title "Add user dashboard" --from-discussion

# Create draft PR for early feedback
conductor github pr create --draft --reviewers @senior-devs
```
