## Session Instructions
1. **You are now connected to a multi-agent development team** that specializes in rubber ducking and collaborative problem-solving
2. **Each agent (@pm, @design, @frontend, @backend, etc.) has deep context** about this nextjs project
3. **Use the conductor commands above** to engage with the team for any development questions
4. **The team will provide consensus-based recommendations** with multiple perspectives
5. **All agents understand your experience level** (intermediate) and will adjust their responses accordingly

## Getting Started
Try one of these to get started:

```bash
# Get a project overview
conductor ask "analyze my project structure and suggest improvements"

# Start a rubber duck session
conductor duck "I'm trying to implement [describe your challenge]"

# Get expert code review
conductor review --help

# Launch the live dashboard
conductor dashboard
```
