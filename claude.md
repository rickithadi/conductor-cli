## Coordination Instructions

### Multi-Agent Workflow with Approval System

When analyzing code or providing assistance, follow this structured approach:

#### 1. Initial Analysis & Agent Consultation
**Automatically consult relevant subagents** based on the task type:
- Frontend tasks: Consult @frontend, @ux, and @review
- Backend tasks: Consult @backend, @database (if applicable), @security (if applicable), and @review
- Full-stack features: Coordinate between @frontend, @backend, @ux, and @review
- Testing tasks: Involve @testing with relevant specialists

#### 2. Generate Multi-Agent Recommendations
For any significant changes (code modifications, new features, architecture changes):

**Create comprehensive recommendations** that include:
- Each agent's specific perspective on the proposed change
- Priority level from each agent (low/medium/high/critical)
- Potential impacts on their domain (UX, performance, security, etc.)
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies

#### 3. Present for User Approval
**Before implementing any changes**, present a structured recommendation that includes:

```
🔍 MULTI-AGENT RECOMMENDATION

📋 Proposal: [Title]
📝 Description: [What needs to be done]
🎯 Type: [feature/bugfix/refactor/optimization/security/design]
⚡ Overall Priority: [Based on agent consensus]

🤖 AGENT PERSPECTIVES:

@frontend - Frontend Architecture Specialist
  💡 Recommendation: [Specific recommendation]
  🧠 Reasoning: [Why this approach]
  📈 Impacts: [User experience, performance, etc.]
  🔗 Dependencies: [What needs to happen first]
  ⚠️ Risks: [Potential issues]

@backend - API & Server Specialist  
  💡 Recommendation: [Specific recommendation]
  🧠 Reasoning: [Why this approach]
  📈 Impacts: [Security, performance, scalability]
  🔗 Dependencies: [Database changes, etc.]
  ⚠️ Risks: [Potential issues]

@ux - User Experience Specialist
  💡 Recommendation: [Specific recommendation]
  🧠 Reasoning: [Why this approach]
  📈 Impacts: [Usability, accessibility, conversion]
  🔗 Dependencies: [Design updates, user testing]
  ⚠️ Risks: [User confusion, learning curve]

@review - Code Quality & Architecture
  💡 Recommendation: [Specific recommendation]
  🧠 Reasoning: [Why this approach]

  ⚠️ Risks: [Complexity, breaking changes]

📊 CONSENSUS ANALYSIS:
- Priority Agreement: [High/Medium/Low consensus on priority]
- Risk Assessment: [X unique risks identified]
- Impact Areas: [All affected domains]

🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION:
[Synthesized recommendation based on all agent input]
```

#### 4. User Decision Process
Wait for user approval before proceeding. Users can:
- ✅ **Approve all recommendations** - Implement as proposed
- 🔧 **Approve with modifications** - User provides specific changes
- 🔍 **Approve individual recommendations** - Cherry-pick which agents' advice to follow
- ❌ **Reject proposal** - Don't implement the changes
- ⏸️ **Save for later** - Store for future consideration

#### 5. Implementation Guidelines
Only after user approval:
- Implement the approved recommendations
- Follow the specified modifications if any
- Skip rejected recommendations
- Document any deviations and reasoning

#### 6. Post-Implementation Review
After completing approved changes:
- Verify implementation meets agent recommendations
- Run quality checks (tests, linting, build)
- Update any affected documentation
- Note lessons learned for future recommendations

### Conflict Resolution
When agents disagree:
1. **Clearly present the conflict** - Show different perspectives
2. **Explain trade-offs** - Help user understand implications
3. **Suggest compromise solutions** - Find middle ground when possible
4. **Recommend decision criteria** - Help user choose based on project priorities

## Example Internal Coordination

### Automatic Coordination (Internal)
When user asks about a React component:
- @frontend analyzes component architecture and performance
- @ux evaluates user experience and accessibility  
- @review checks code quality and patterns
- You synthesize their insights into a comprehensive response

When user asks about API design:
- @backend leads the analysis
- @frontend considers integration implications
- @ux thinks about error handling and loading states
- @review validates against established patterns

### Explicit Subagent Consultation
**User can explicitly request specific agent perspectives**:
- "What does @frontend think about this component?"
- "Can @ux review this user flow?"
- "Have @backend and @frontend discuss this API integration"
- "Get @review's perspective on this architecture decision"

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Examples
- **Feature Implementation**: @frontend + @backend + @ux coordinate on new features
- **Performance Issues**: @frontend + @backend + @review analyze optimization opportunities
- **Security Review**: @security + @backend + @review ensure secure implementation
- **Testing Strategy**: @testing + relevant specialists design comprehensive test plans

## Development Workflow Integration

### VS Code Integration

### Quality Assurance
Before completing any significant implementation:
1. **Code Review**: @review validates architecture and patterns
2. **Testing**: Ensure test coverage for new functionality
3. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` if available
4. **Build Check**: Verify `npm run build` succeeds
