# Branch Protection Rules Configuration

This document outlines the required branch protection settings for the main branch to ensure code quality and prevent breaking changes.

## Required Settings for `main` branch:

### üîí General Protection Rules
- [x] **Restrict pushes that create files that exceed GitHub's file size limit**
- [x] **Restrict pushes that create files that exceed this limit: 100 MB**

### üß™ Required Status Checks
The following checks must pass before merging:

- [x] **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- [x] **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

**Required Checks:**
- `quality-gates` - Linting, type checking, and unit tests
- `e2e-testing (ubuntu-latest, 18)` - Core E2E tests on primary platform
- `performance-testing` - Performance benchmarks must pass
- `security-scan` - Security vulnerability scanning

**Optional Checks (recommended but not blocking):**
- `e2e-testing (macos-latest, 18)` - macOS compatibility
- `e2e-testing (windows-latest, 18)` - Windows compatibility
- `e2e-testing (ubuntu-latest, 16)` - Node 16 compatibility
- `e2e-testing (ubuntu-latest, 20)` - Node 20 compatibility

### üë• Pull Request Requirements
- [x] **Require a pull request before merging**
- [x] **Require approvals: 1**
- [x] **Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed**
- [x] **Require review from code owners** (if CODEOWNERS file exists)
- [x] **Restrict approvals to users with write permissions**

### üîê Push Restrictions
- [x] **Restrict pushes that create files**
- [x] **Include administrators** - Even admins must follow the process

### üìã Additional Rules
- [x] **Require signed commits** (recommended for security)
- [x] **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- [x] **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**

## GitHub CLI Setup Commands

To configure these settings automatically using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Enable branch protection for main
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["quality-gates","e2e-testing (ubuntu-latest, 18)","performance-testing","security-scan"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"dismiss_stale_reviews":true,"require_code_owner_reviews":true,"required_approving_review_count":1}' \
  --field restrictions=null

# Alternatively, use the web interface at:
# https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multi-agent-workflow/settings/branches
```

## E2E Test Quality Gate

The most critical quality gate is the **End-to-End Onboarding Flow Test** which validates:

1. ‚úÖ Project initialization completes successfully
2. ‚úÖ Configuration files are created correctly
3. ‚úÖ Launch command validates environment properly
4. ‚úÖ Agent orchestration works as expected
5. ‚úÖ Context generation produces valid output
6. ‚úÖ User experience flows work end-to-end
7. ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks meet thresholds
8. ‚úÖ Error handling works correctly

If any of these fail, the PR cannot be merged to `main`.

## Performance Thresholds

The performance tests enforce these maximum response times:
- **Initialization**: 15 seconds
- **Launch Validation**: 10 seconds  
- **Status Commands**: 2 seconds
- **Help Commands**: 1 second

Exceeding these thresholds will fail the build.

## Security Requirements

Security scanning includes:
- npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- OWASP dependency check
- Static code analysis for security patterns
- No secrets or credentials in code

## Manual Override Process

In emergency situations, administrators can:
1. Create a hotfix branch from `main`
2. Apply critical fixes
3. Create emergency PR with detailed justification
4. Temporarily disable specific checks if needed
5. Merge with admin override (with full audit trail)
6. Immediately re-enable all protections
7. Schedule follow-up to address any skipped checks
